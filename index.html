    <h1>🏏 Virat Kohli 🏏</h1>
    <p>A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory in the
         Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008.  In an Indian team filled with saint-like 
         icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 
         'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.
